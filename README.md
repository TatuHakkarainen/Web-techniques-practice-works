A Bootstrap web site must contain at least 3 web pages. Bootstrap components buttons, accordion and navbar are used on web pages. A Javascript form is added to the site. The javascript form must have a button that, when pressed, displays the person's name and message. This information is stored and added to the list below the form. In the task, it is not necessary to follow the appearance/layout according to the picture. If the important-checkbox is selected, some different formatting is added to the saved note. The example in the picture uses a red border. The date and time of the moment when the deposit is made is applied to the note.
